## Overview ad Origin:
 * BlackRock, Inc.
 * BlackRock, Inc. was founded in 1988 by Robert S. Kapito and Laurence D. Fink. Both Kapito and Fink worked at First Boston, a New York-based investment bank, when the idea to provide clients with asset management services from a risk management perspective came to Fink after losing $100 million as head of First Boston.
 * Fink initially received funding from Pete Peterson of The Blackstone Group, a private equity alternative investment management firm, who believed in Fink's idea. Within months they became profitable and quadrupled their assets to $2.7 Billion, and while doing so changed the name from Blackstone Financial Management to BlackRock Financial Management. 
    Today BlackRock is one of the world's largest investment management companies with AUM (Assets Under Management), and around 81% of their revenue comes from Investment Advisory, Administration Fees, and Securities Lendings. Their 2019 revenue was $14.539 Billion and Net Income was $4.484 Billion!
